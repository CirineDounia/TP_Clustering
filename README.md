TP Clustering
This project demonstrates clustering techniques applied to a given dataset using a Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook tp_clustering.ipynb contains all steps from data loading to visualization and cluster analysis.

Project Structure
tp_clustering.ipynb: Main notebook containing the full clustering workflow.
README.md: Documentation explaining how to run and understand the project.
Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
The following Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the dependencies with:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run the Notebook
Clone this repository:
<!-- -->
git clone https://github.com/CirineDounia/TP_Clustering
Navigate to the project folder:
<!-- -->
cd TP_Clustering
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
<!-- -->
jupyter notebook
Open the file tp_clustering.ipynb.
Workflow Description
1. Data Loading
The notebook imports the dataset, performs initial inspection and prepares it for clustering.

2. Data Preprocessing
Steps include: - Cleaning missing values\

Standardizing variables\
Selecting relevant features
3. Applying Clustering Algorithms
The notebook applies different clustering methods such as: - K-Means\

Hierarchical Clustering
The notebook also includes steps for choosing the number of clusters using methods such as: - Elbow Method\

Dendrogram Analysis
4. Visualization
Clusters are plotted to help interpret the grouping results.

5. Interpretation
The results are analyzed and conclusions are drawn about the structure and meaning of the clusters.

Reproducibility
All steps are run in the notebook in a sequential manner. Ensure that the dataset and dependencies are correctly set up.
